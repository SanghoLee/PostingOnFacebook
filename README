# Django + Facebook Graph API authentication
This is a django app to use the new Graph API authentication with Django. It uses the standard authentication build into Django.
And If you write a posting here, we will write your posting on your Facebook.

Make sure you read http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/ to have an idea of how this is intended to work.

## Basic setup for example project
1. Come to here(PostingOnFacebook/)
2. Set up the FACEBOOK_APP_ID and FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET to your Facebook app (Set one up at https://developers.facebook.com/apps)
3. Run `python manage.py syncdb`
4. Run `python manage.py runserver`
5. Go to http://localhost:8000 and Signin! Try to write a posting!

## settings.py
Here are the differences between a base Django settings.py and the ones needed for the example project to run:

    FACEBOOK_APP_ID = os.environ['FACEBOOK_APP_ID']
    FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET = os.environ['FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET']
    FACEBOOK_SCOPE = 'publish_stream,offline_access'
    INSTALLED_APPS = ['PostingOnFacebook.post']
